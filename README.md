# Introduction

A simple MATLAB interface which allows to perform subjective evaluation tests using Stimulus Comparison Adjectival Categorical Judgment (SCACJ) method [1]. In this method, two stimuli (e.g., images or videos) are shown side by side and then the subject gives a score between +1 (slightly better) and +3 (much better) to the most pleasant image, or a score of 0 in case of similar quality. After, the subjective scores are normalized in the range [0,10]. Refer to [2] for more details.
